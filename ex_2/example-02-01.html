        <p id="intro">This is the <i>introduction</i> paragraph. It has an <b>'id' attribute with the value of "intro"</b>. It is styled differently from all other paragraphs, using a CSS rule with an <i>ID Selector</i>.</p>
        <p>This is the <i>second</i> paragraph. It <b>does not</b> have an 'id' attribute.</p>
        <p>I hope to learn as much as I can in this class so that I can make an awesome webmap at the end of class for my final project. I have not looked at the final project instructions but I have a friend who travels and is a great photographer. It would be cool to make a webmap that she can upload her photos to and it shows exactly where the photo was taken on a world map.</p>
        <p>This is the <i>third</i> paragraph. It <b>also does not</b> have an 'id' attribute.</p>
        <p>This is a <i>fourth</i> paragraph that I have created just to tell you to <b>HAVE A GREAT DAY!</b></p>
